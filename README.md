# quant<sup>php</sup>
all-purpose library for a general-purpose scripting language.

quant is a library for PHP >= 8.2. It is a result of [conjoon](https://conjoon.org) and several other open / closed 
source projects, where functionality has proven useful to justify a refactoring into a shared library.

## Installation

```bash
$ composer require quant/quant
```

## Documentation
The docs for the project can be found at https://quant-php.dev.
